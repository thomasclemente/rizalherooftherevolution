                <h2 class="section-title">About the Game</h2>
                <p class="text">Video games are one of the most popular hobbies in the world, enjoyed by millions across different generations and cultures. 
                    The versatility of video games that can cater to different preferences of different demographics, from strategy and adventure to simulation and storytelling, 
                    can be one of the reasons for their popularity. As technology evolves throughout time, video games adapt and evolve with the technology to remain relevant and garner new audiences.</p>
                <p class="text">Technology has rapidly advanced, revolutionizing the modern gaming industry. Gaming has grown from the days of simple pixelated graphics and basic gameplay mechanics to a 
                    multi-billion dollar industry that provides immersive virtual reality experiences, realistic graphics, and intricate storytelling. Technology has enabled game developers to push the 
                    boundaries of creativity and innovation, providing players around the world with unforgettable experiences (Start Motion Media, 2023).</p>
                <p class="text">One of the advantages of video games is their use in different ways to educate, promote, and such. Games have the potential to be educational 
                    by transforming and modifying traditionally passive learning environments, especially history, into active and game environments that students will find engaging. 
                    As stated in the study of Li et al. (2024), digital educational games can increase students' motivation to learn, which is mediated by student learning engagement. 
                    By increasing their engagement and encouraging a positive attitude toward learning. Furthermore, their findings indicate that a high digital environment in schools 
                    has a moderating effect on this process. Students are more likely to be drawn into digital educational games in a conducive digital environment, which boosts their desire and motivation to learn.</p>
                <p class="text">Everyone is now living in a world of modernization, full of gadgets and cybertechnology. A class that talks about history and a national hero can often lead to a boring class and a boring subject. 
                    People have differences in interest and attention span. History can easily become boring because of the various data that is being thrown out to the students. But the problem is, do people know history? 
                    In an article by Bautista (2022), an episode of the TV show "Pinoy Big Brother," teenage contestants incorrectly answered questions related to Philippine history, such as the nickname of national hero Jose Rizal, 
                    mistakenly calling him "J. Rizal" instead of "Pepe." This mistake highlighted the lack of historical knowledge among younger generations. Traditional history education often lacks the engagement required to inspire a 
                    deep understanding of key historical figures and events, like those of Jose Rizal. This problem is evident in low student interest and retention regarding the history of the Philippines.</p>
                <p class="text">Rizal is a person that every Filipino should know, because knowing him means knowing Philippine history and its identity. Rizal's life and works are an effective way to instill inspiration in aspiring students, 
                    but with the progression of technology, they are being left behind and stagnant. Jose Rizal is the national hero of the Philippines. His life and work are history. 
                    Rizal is an important figure in the Philippines who shaped the country into what it is today. Rizal has been instrumental in the Filipinos' bid towards independence and several developments in various sectors. 
                    Rizal also made contributions to art, literature, and medicine, which continue to fascinate his countrymen today (Taculao, 2021).</p>
                <p class="text">By tapping into the natural enjoyment of play, educational video games and gamified learning tools offer a promising avenue for teaching complex 
                    subjects in a way that feels less like rote learning and more like entertainment. Thus, creating a game like "RIZAL: Hero of the Revolution" not only harnesses the 
                    motivational power of video games but also addresses a gap in cultural education by making Philippine history more accessible and engaging for younger audiences. 
                    By enabling players to explore historical locations, interact with characters, and solve puzzles that reflect historical events, game development offers an effective way to convey the story of Jose Rizal.</p>
                <p class="text">Rizal: Hero of the Revolution aims to teach Rizal's life and works and grants students a sense of nationalism and patriotism, both of which are essential for the Philippines' 
                    growth and development. Today's youth play a critical role in upholding Rizal's legacy and shaping the nation's future. It aims to solve these problems by immersing students in an interactive 
                    historical experience. Players will explore Rizal's life through the narratives, learning about his significant contributions to the country while participating in the story. 
                    The game's adventures and questions will require players to understand historical events, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of Rizal's ideals and actions. This solution 
                    provides a dynamic learning tool that moves away from rote memorization and promotes active participation in learning, which is key to improving engagement and retention.</p>
