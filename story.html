                <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 1<br>Jose Rizal's Childhood and Academic Journey<br>(1861-1882)</h2>
                <p class="text">In the quiet town of Calamba, Laguna, on June 19, 1861, a child was born who would later light the fires of change in the Philippines. 
                    This child, José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda, would grow to be a beacon of hope for his people. Son of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso, 
                    Rizal was a man of extraordinary gifts—a physician, poet, writer, and scholar. Above all, he was a patriot, dedicating his life to the pursuit of freedom and justice for his fellow Filipinos.</p>
                <p class="text">In 1861, Rizal was baptized, marking the beginning of a life that would be both extraordinary and challenging. By 1864, his mother began teaching him the alphabet, 
                    and he quickly mastered it, showcasing an early love for learning. His early education was informal, as his mother and various private tutors—among them Maestro Celestino, Maestro Lucas Padua, 
                    and Leon Monroy—guided his studies. Each of these figures imparted different lessons, from Latin to reading and writing. His uncles also played a vital role: Uncle Manuel nurtured his love for the outdoors, 
                    and Uncle Gregorio instilled a deep passion for learning.</p>
                <p class="text">Tragedy struck in 1865 when his younger sister Concepcion, or “Concha,” passed away at just three years old. This loss left a profound mark on young Jose, 
                    who experienced the pain of losing someone close for the first time. Despite his grief, Rizal found solace in his studies, and in 1869, he composed his first poem, 
                    Sa Aking Mga Kabata ("To My Fellow Children"), expressing his love for his native tongue and a growing awareness of the value of his heritage.</p>
                <p class="text">In 1869, Rizal's father sent him to Biñan, Laguna, to study under the renowned teacher Justiniano Aquino Cruz. Here, he endured strict discipline and a rigorous education, 
                    honing his skills in reading, writing, arithmetic, and religion. By 1872, Rizal was accepted into Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he excelled in various subjects, 
                    earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1877. His time at Ateneo laid the groundwork for his intellectual pursuits, exposing him to philosophy, literature, science, and art.</p>
                <p class="text">After graduating from Ateneo, Rizal began studying medicine at the University of Santo Tomas. His experiences there, particularly the discriminatory treatment he faced, 
                    solidified his awareness of the injustices his people suffered under Spanish rule. In 1882, he left for Spain, determined to complete his studies at the Universidad Central de Madrid. 
                    His journey to Europe marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life—one that would see him rise as a voice for his people.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 2<br>Jose Rizal's Literary Journey<br>(1884-1893)</h2>
                <p class="text">In 1884, while studying in Madrid, Rizal began writing Noli Me Tangere (“Touch Me Not”), a novel that would lay bare the hardships and suffering endured by Filipinos under colonial rule. 
                    Through the character of Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra, he highlighted the injustices and cruelties his countrymen faced, hoping to inspire empathy and change. Writing the novel was no easy task; Rizal 
                    poured his heart and soul into each page, determined to use his words as a weapon against oppression.</p>
                <p class="text">In 1886, Rizal moved to Germany, where he deepened his medical knowledge at the University of Heidelberg. Under the mentorship of Dr. Otto Becker, Rizal mastered ophthalmology, 
                    a skill he intended to bring back to the Philippines to restore sight to the blind—both literally and metaphorically. Despite financial hardship and isolation, Rizal persevered, eventually 
                    finishing Noli Me Tangere in 1887 with the financial assistance of his friend Maximo Viola.</p>
                <p class="text">El Filibusterismo (“The Subversive”), Rizal's second novel, took on a darker tone, capturing his growing disillusionment with Spanish rule. Written partly in his hometown of Calamba, 
                    El Fili explores themes of vengeance and despair, symbolizing the escalating anger and frustration felt by Filipinos. Rizal poured his deepest emotions into this work, striving to reflect the pain, 
                    oppression, and yearning for freedom that had become the heart of his people's struggle.</p>
                <p class="text">In 1892, Rizal founded La Liga Filipina, an organization dedicated to unity, cooperation, and peaceful reform, in Manila. La Liga Filipina sought to empower Filipinos through education 
                    and mutual support, standing as a testament to Rizal's belief in peaceful change. However, the Spanish authorities saw this organization as a threat, leading to his arrest and exile to Dapitan in 1893. 
                    This marked the beginning of Rizal's last chapter—a time of isolation, reflection, and a continued commitment to his country.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 3<br>Jose Rizal's Exile and Execution<br>(1893-1896)</h2>
                <p class="text">In August 1893, Rizal was exiled to Dapitan, a remote town in Mindanao. Despite his isolation, he remained active and hopeful, transforming Dapitan into a center of learning and progress. 
                    Rizal established a school, taught local children, built water systems, and even practiced medicine, improving the lives of Dapitan's residents. His dedication to his people persisted, even in the 
                    face of persecution.</p>
                <p class="text">On December 26, 1896, Rizal faced a military trial, accused of treason, sedition, and involvement in illegal organizations. The charges were spurred by his alleged role in inspiring the 
                    Philippine Revolution through his writings and associations. Two days later, he was informed of his death sentence, and on December 29, he composed his final poem, Mi Último Adiós ("My Last Farewell"). 
                    This moving piece reflected his enduring love for the Philippines, expressing hope for its future and his acceptance of his fate.</p>
                <p class="text">On the morning of December 30, 1896, Rizal was led to Bagumbayan Field for his execution. Refusing a blindfold, he chose to face his death unflinching, a testament to his courage and conviction. 
                    In his last moments, he turned to face the firing squad, falling with his gaze toward the sky. His execution marked the end of his life but ignited a revolution that would eventually free his people.</p>
                <p class="text">Through his words and deeds, Rizal left a legacy that endures to this day, reminding Filipinos of their strength, resilience, and right to freedom.</p>
